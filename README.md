# Ted Whitson Bootcamp 01_Challenge

## KU Course Module 1 Challenge is to refractor existing HTML and CSS code for a company called HoriSEOn. 
   
	- The goal is to make the page more accessible for adaptive technologies and to improve the codebase for future maintenance and ease of use.
	- The HTML and CSS code are not to industry standards and need to be reordered and condensed.
	- This project allowed me to increase my knowledge regaring semantic HTML tags, CSS styling, code structure of both HTML and CSS, and the different forms and applications of adaptive accessibility.
